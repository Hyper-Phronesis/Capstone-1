# Capstone-1
Three Different Lessons from Three Different Clustering Analyses: Map Risk Clusters of Neighbourhoods in the time of Pandemic

I would like to make two comments on this project.

As my first comment, since Github page would not render the ipynb file for an unknown reason, I would suggest the readers to copy and paste the link to nebviewer to generate the image. I followed the suggestion by https://towardsdatascience.com/jupyter-notebook-not-rendering-on-github-heres-a-simple-solution-e51aa6ca29b6 

 - the site link to nbviewer: https://nbviewer.org/
 - a rendered image: https://nbviewer.org/github/Hyper-Phronesis/Capstone-1/blob/master/Capstone%20Three%20Different%20Lessons%20from%20Three%20Different%20Clusterings.ipynb

As my second comment, the data source has been modified at the discretion of the data site owner, the Argentinean government. Therefore, some of the data used for the project is unfortunately unavailable today.
