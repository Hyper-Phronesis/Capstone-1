# Capstone-1
Three Different Lessons from Three Different Clustering Analyses: Map Risk Clusters of Neighbourhoods in the time of Pandemic

I would like to make two comments on this project.

As my first comment, since Github page would not render the ipynb file for an unknown reason, the readers can follow the suggestion by https://towardsdatascience.com/jupyter-notebook-not-rendering-on-github-heres-a-simple-solution-e51aa6ca29b6 to render the image of the notebook file by simply making copy and paste the link of the file to nbviewer to generate the image. Here are:

 - the site link to nbviewer: https://nbviewer.org/
 - a rendered image: https://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/deeporigami/Capstone-1/blob/master/Capstone%20Three%20Different%20Lessons%20from%20Three%20Different%20Clusterings.ipynb

As my second comment, the data source has been modified at the discretion of the data site owner, the Argentinean government and Buenos Aires City Government. Therefore, some of the data used for the project is unfortunately unavailable today.

Here is an associated link to my article post at Medium: https://deeporigami.medium.com/three-different-lessons-from-three-different-clustering-analyses-data-science-capstone-5f2be29cb3b2
